# Single Element in a Sorted Array (Medium)

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

### Example 1:
```
Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```
 
Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

## Solution
The non-sorted version of this problem is [#136](../p136e/README.md) can be solved in O(n).

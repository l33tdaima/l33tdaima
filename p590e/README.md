# 590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal (Easy)

Given an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

```
            1
        /   |   \
       3    2    4
     /   \ 
    5     6
```

Return its postorder traversal as: [5,6,3,2,4,1].

### Note:
Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

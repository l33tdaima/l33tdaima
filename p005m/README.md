# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring (Medium)

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example:

Input: "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example:

Input: "cbbd"

Output: "bb"

## Solution
The fastest O(N) solution is Manacher's Algorithm, though it is not trivial to code.

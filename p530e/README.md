# 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST (Easy)

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

### Example 1:

```
          4
        /   \
       2     6
     /   \
    1     3

Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:

```
          1
        /   \
       0    48
           /   \
          12    49

Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- `The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^4].`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

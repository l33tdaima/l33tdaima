#589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal (Easy)

Given an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

``` 
            1
        /   |   \
       3    2    4
     /   \ 
    5     6

Return its preorder traversal as: [1,3,5,6,2,4].
```

Return its preorder traversal as: [1,3,5,6,2,4].

### Note:
Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

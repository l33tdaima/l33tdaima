# 22. Generate Parentheses (Medium)

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:

[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]

## Solution:
The idea here is to only add '(' and ')' that we know will guarantee us a solution (instead of adding 1 too many close). Once we add a '(' we will then discard it and try a ')' which can only close a valid '('. Each of these steps are recursively called.

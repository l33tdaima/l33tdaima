# 314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal (Medium)

Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from top to bottom, column by column).

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right.

Examples:

- Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

   3
  /\
 /  \
 9  20
    /\
   /  \
  15   7
return its vertical order traversal as:
[
  [9],
  [3,15],
  [20],
  [7]
]

- Given binary tree [3,9,8,4,0,1,7],
     3
    /\
   /  \
   9   8
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
 4  01   7
return its vertical order traversal as:
[
  [4],
  [9],
  [3,0,1],
  [8],
  [7]
]

- Given binary tree [3,9,8,4,0,1,7,null,null,null,2,5] (0's right child is 2 and 1's left child is 5),
     3
    /\
   /  \
   9   8
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
 4  01   7
    /\
   /  \
   5   2
return its vertical order traversal as:
[
  [4],
  [9,5],
  [3,0,1],
  [8,2],
  [7]
]

## Solution
- Traverse the tree via BFS (Require top to down, otherwise DFS is also fine), add the value to a map using key 0 for root, (key - 1) for left child, and (key + 1) for right child, the value for the map is a list of node value.
- Eventually output the map content linearly.

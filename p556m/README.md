# 556. Next Greater Element III (Medium)

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer n and is greater in value than n. If no such positive integer exists, return -1.

Note that the returned integer should fit in 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in 32-bit integer, return -1.

### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 21
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 21
Output: -1
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

## Solution

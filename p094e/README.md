# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal (Easy)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Example 1:

```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

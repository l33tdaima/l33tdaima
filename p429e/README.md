# 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal (Easy)

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a 3-ary tree:
```
              1
          /   |   \
         3    2    4
       /  \
      5    6
```
We should return its level order traversal:
```
[
    [1],
    [3,2,4],
    [5,6]
]
```

### Note:
1. The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
2. The total number of nodes is at most 5000.

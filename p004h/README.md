# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard)

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

## Solution
Searching i in [0, m], to find an object `i` that:
    (j == 0 or i == m or B[j-1] <= A[i]) and
    (i == 0 or j == n or A[i-1] <= B[j])
    where j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i

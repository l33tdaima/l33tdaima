# 389. Find the Difference (Easy)

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in `t`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
